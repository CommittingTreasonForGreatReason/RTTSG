every scene is in the scenes Package and in the Scenes Enum. 
scenes are handelt over the scenehandler. 
the repaint thread and the displayed scene gets automatically changed over schuffelTo(Scenes)
It is designed that way so that you get 3 autonomous modules (Login, Menu, Game) which can then be developed separately and switched between easily.
For now that only counts for the displaying of the scenes. A system for the gamelogig is not jet in place
